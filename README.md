## **1. Executive Summary & Motivation**

Modern ground station antennas—used in radar imaging and communication arrays—rely on **precise electronic beam steering**. This requires rapid computation of **phase and amplitude values** for each antenna element, based on incoming elevation and azimuth angles.

### The Problem

* **General-purpose CPUs**: struggle with real-time computation of sine, cosine, and multiplication-heavy phase equations, leading to performance bottlenecks.
* **Reliability & Security**: Ground stations are critical infrastructure. Without **ECC-protected memory** and **secure boot mechanisms**, systems remain vulnerable to data corruption and unauthorized firmware.
* **Scalability**: As arrays grow larger (hundreds to thousands of elements), the **compute and data movement burden** grows exponentially.

### Our Solution

We propose the design of a **secure, small-area RISC-V based SoC** tailored for ground station antenna control:

1. **CORDIC + LUT Hybrid Phase Engine**: Custom accelerator to compute phase values with high throughput and reduced CPU stalls.
2. **On-Chip RISC-V Core**: Manages system control, data movement, and software programmability.
3. **ECC-Protected Memory System**: Detects and corrects bit errors during critical computations.
4. **Secure Boot and Cryptography**: Ensures only trusted firmware runs, protecting ground station reliability.
5. **Efficient Bus Interface (APB/AXI-Lite)**: Lightweight, streamlined interconnect for high performance and simplicity in verification and physical design.

This project directly addresses **real-world application needs** while aligning with the **EE599 full ASIC design flow**—from architecture definition to RTL design, verification, physical implementation, signoff, and tape-out.

#### Prior works show the demand for dedicated hardware in antenna phase control.  
- Wang et al. (2025) present a **reconfigurable FPGA beamformer** achieving < 1° DOA error with flexible phase steps, highlighting the need for real-time hardware solutions in phased arrays.  
  [Wang et al., *Sensors*, 2025](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/8/2497?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- Agarwal et al. (2021) design a **single-precision arithmetic beamformer**, showing the tradeoffs between floating-point precision and hardware cost.

## **2. Problem Statement & Technical Objectives**

### **The Problem**

Electronic beam steering in phased-array ground station antennas requires **precise, real-time computation of phase shifts** for each transmit/receive module (TRM).

The **phase equation** involves trigonometric functions and multiplications:

$$
Ψ = \frac{2\pi}{λ} \big[ d_{az}\cos(θ)\sin(φ) + d_{el}\sin(θ) \big]
$$

* **High Computational Demand**: With large antenna arrays (hundreds of TRMs), these calculations must be repeated continuously as the beam direction changes.
* **CPU Bottleneck**: Conventional CPUs rely on floating-point units (FPUs) for sin/cos operations. These instructions are **iterative and slow**, causing pipeline stalls. As a result, the CPU spends most of its cycles waiting on trig computations instead of managing higher-level tasks.
* **Data Integrity Risks**: Ground stations operate in mission-critical conditions. Even a single corrupted memory bit (from natural upsets or board-level interference) can produce incorrect beam pointing data.
* **Security Risks**: Firmware tampering or unauthorized updates could compromise entire antenna operations, highlighting the need for secure boot and cryptographic validation.

#### CPU-based solutions often stall on trig loops, motivating dedicated math hardware.  
- Yan et al. (2018) propose **sub-array adaptive digital beamforming using CORDIC**, demonstrating the hardware complexity vs. precision tradeoff in trig-heavy computations.  
  [Yan et al., *ICETE Conference*, 2018](https://www.scitepress.org/papers/2018/69720/69720.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  


### **Technical Objectives**

Our project targets these pain points with four key objectives:

1. **Accelerated Phase Computation**

   * Develop a **CORDIC + LUT hybrid engine** that computes sine/cosine values and final phase results efficiently, minimizing CPU stalls.

2. **On-Chip Programmable Core**

   * Integrate a **compact RISC-V CPU** to handle system coordination, drivers, and programmability.
   * Ensure the main processor remains free while the accelerator performs heavy math.

3. **Reliability through ECC Memory**

   * Implement **SECDED ECC protection** for on-chip SRAM and provide background scrubbing to safeguard antenna steering data.

4. **Security by Design**

   * Enable **secure boot** using SHA-256 and ECDSA for firmware authentication.
   * Provide a **secure debug interface** with controlled life-cycle states to prevent unauthorized access.

5. **System-Level Efficiency**

   * Use a **lightweight APB/AXI-Lite bus** for predictable data transfers and reduced verification complexity.
   * Optimize the system for **50–80 MHz operation** in ASIC tape-out conditions.

### **3.7 Key Design Principles**

* **CPU + Co-Processor Synergy**: The CPU runs orchestration; the math co-processor handles deterministic trig workloads.
* **Security Built-In, Not Bolted On**: Secure boot, ECC, watchdogs, and lifecycle debug are part of the base design.
* **DFT from Day 1**: Scan, MBIST, and observability hooks included early, not retrofitted.
* **Simplicity for Tape-Out**: One clock domain, modular RTL, AXI-Lite/APB, and modest 50–80 MHz clock target.

#### *Reference:* Hardware-software co-design for controlling phase shifters has been studied:  
- A 2025 design by IOSR-JEEE demonstrates a **phased-array beam control system** using HLS + RTL, distributing phase commands efficiently over bus interfaces.

---




## **5. Verification & DFT Plan**

Ensuring **functional correctness, reliability, and testability** is central to this project. We will employ a multi-layered verification and DFT (Design-for-Test) strategy, aligned with industry best practices but scoped for semester timelines.

---

   * Python/MATLAB reference for:

     * CORDIC iterations and LUT-based sine/cosine.
     * Full phase equation evaluation.
     * ECC encoding/decoding and error injection.
   * Used as scoreboards in SystemVerilog testbenches.

2. **Unit-Level Verification**

   * Each module (RISC-V core wrapper, math co-processor, ECC SRAM, security island) has **directed tests** + **constrained-random inputs**.
   * Corner cases: extreme angles (±30°), invalid configs, ECC single- and double-bit flips, secure boot with tampered signature.

3. **Integration-Level Verification**

   * End-to-end tests: CPU configures co-processor, co-processor computes phase, results stored in ECC SRAM, retrieved and verified.
   * Software-driven verification: run **bare-metal C tests** compiled for RISC-V inside simulation.

4. **Formal Verification (Targeted)**

   * Assertions for bus handshakes (APB/AXI-Lite ready/valid).

These will be scripted into regression campaigns.

---

Here’s a refined **Section 6** with the EEA (Energy, Efficiency, Area) targets updated to *TSMC 28 nm* node, along with literature-backed references for area estimates. Wherever I've used a paper or source, I've explicitly cited it.

---

Got it — here’s **Section 6** with **EEA (Energy, Efficiency, Area)** targets for **TSMC 28 nm**, and with an explicit reference (hyperlinked via citation) everywhere a quantitative estimate appears.

---

## 6. Physical Design & EEA Strategy (TSMC 28 nm)

We set **Energy, Efficiency, and Area** goals using concrete data points from peer-reviewed or vendor sources at/near **28 nm**. Where a direct number isn’t published (e.g., a full SoC total), we derive a conservative target from cited module-level data and state the assumption.

---

### 6.1 Energy (Power) Targets

* **Operating frequency:** **50–80 MHz** (chosen to ease timing/IR and align with a microcontroller-class SoC at 28 nm). Frequency capability for embedded RISC-V at 28 nm is well above this (E31 typical \~1.45 GHz at 28 nm HPC), so our target is conservative relative to published silicon capability. ([HubSpot][1])
* **Core supply voltage:** **\~1.0–1.2 V** (typical for 28 nm CMOS libraries); **1.8 V** I/O as needed (PDK-dependent). Library/process guidance for 28HPC/HPC+ corroborates these ranges. ([Synopsys][2])
* **Dynamic power budget (SoC):** **≤ 80 mW @ 50 MHz**. Rationale: Microcontroller-class RISC-V in 28 nm demonstrates high performance-per-mW (E31 datasheet shows **59.4 DMIPS/mW @ 1.4 GHz** on 28 nm HPC). Running 20–30× slower with aggressive clock-gating on co-processor/crypto is consistent with ≤ 80 mW system power for our block sizes; this is a **derived target** (backed by the E31 perf-per-mW baseline). ([HubSpot][1])
* **Idle/leakage fraction:** **≤ 10–15%** of total, via pervasive **clock-gating** (co-processor, scrubber, crypto) and optional power-gating islands—standard 28 nm practice. ([Synopsys][2])

> **Note:** The quantitative **≤ 80 mW** SoC target is a design **goal** derived from the cited 28 nm efficiency characteristics (not a direct sum of vendor IP numbers). We’ll validate it with post-layout power estimates.

---

### 6.2 Efficiency Targets

* **Throughput/latency (math co-processor):** After pipeline fill, **1 phase result / 1–2 cycles** is achievable based on pipelined CORDIC datapaths reported at 28 nm scale (e.g., a 28 nm CORDIC with **0.09 mm²** area demonstrates dense, pipelinable trig at this node). We adopt that micro-architecture pattern. ([ResearchGate][3])
* **End-to-end phase update (≈32 TRMs):** **≤ 200 µs** (system goal). Backed by the above CORDIC/LUT throughput and a modest bus at 50–80 MHz. (Derived from cited CORDIC capabilities). ([ResearchGate][3])
* **Secure boot overhead:** **≤ 10%** of startup time with SHA-256 + ECDSA-P256 verify. 28 nm SHA-256 cores show sub-0.25 mm², 100s MHz capability; ECDSA verify engines in adjacent nodes (or 28 nm when available) fit sub-mm² (see area table below), so firmware-size signatures can be checked within the budgeted window. ([MDPI][4])

(ECC wrappers + margins push total upward.) ([arXiv][6])                                                               | With periphery/ECC wrappers, banking, and floorplan margin, we budget                                                                                      | **\~ 1.0 mm²**  |

### 6.4 Floorplanning & Density

* **Co-locate math co-processor + SRAM** to minimize netlength/congestion; SRAM density assumption uses **\~1.80 Mb/mm²** at 28 nm as a sanity check for memory footprint. ([arXiv][6])
* **Fence the security island** (ROM/TRNG/crypto/JTAG) for clear power/clock intent and easier lifecycle gating; SHA-256/ECDSA areas drive the footprint. ([MDPI][4])
* **Clock-tree goal:** skew < 5% of cycle at 50–80 MHz (easy margin relative to 28 nm library speeds). ([Synopsys][2])

---

### 6.5 Sign-off & EEA Compliance

* **Energy:** Post-layout (extracted) power ≤ target; leverage 28 nm clock-/power-gating guidance. ([Synopsys][2])
* **Efficiency:** Pipeline CORDIC/LUT meets throughput; secure-boot verify (SHA-256 + ECDSA-P256) within **≤ 10%** added startup latency based on cited block capabilities. ([ResearchGate][3])
* **Area:** Per-block budgets (table above) sum to **≤ 3.5 mm²** with conservative margins; RISC-V/crypto/memory footprints anchored to 28 nm publications. ([HubSpot][1])
* **DRC/LVS/STA/IR/EM:** Standard 28 nm closure criteria per foundry/library recommendations. ([Synopsys][2])

---

### 6.6 Risks & Mitigations (Area/Energy-driven)

* **ECDSA area overruns** → Prefer **verify-only** core, share big-integer units, or time-multiplex multipliers; fall back to SW-assist for rare operations. (Bounded by sub-mm² class implied by literature/IP.) ([MDPI][5])
* **SRAM + ECC wrapper larger than planned** → Trim to **16 KB**, raise utilization, reduce port count; density still favorable at 28 nm per published macro data. ([arXiv][6])
* **Math co-processor timing** → Add a pipeline stage; CORDIC at 28 nm is compact and pipelines well. ([ResearchGate][3])
* **SoC power > 80 mW** → Increase gating granularity; lower fclk; rely on demonstrated 28 nm perf-per-mW headroom of embedded cores. ([HubSpot][1])

---

### Reference List (quick access)

* **SiFive E31 (28 nm HPC) area & efficiency:** E31 Core Complex **0.187 mm²** (with 16 KB I\$ / 16 KB DTIM); **0.0286 mm²** core-only; 59.4 DMIPS/mW @ 1.4 GHz. ([HubSpot][1])
* **CORDIC in 28 nm:** Decision-Based CORDIC hardware, **\~0.09 mm²** @ 28 nm (core area). ([ResearchGate][3])
* **SHA-256 in 28 nm:** Zhang et al. ASIC **\~0.210 mm²** @ 28 nm (surveyed in 2023). ([MDPI][4])
* **ECDSA P-256 area comparator:** Low-area ECDSA core **0.257 mm² @ 45 nm** (prime-field ECC), used as an **upper-bound comparator**; 28 nm should be smaller for similar design. ([MDPI][5])
* **SRAM density at 28 nm:** Recent 28 nm 6T-SRAM macro **\~1.80 Mb/mm²** (area basis for 32 KB ≈ 0.142 mm² raw). ([arXiv][6])

## **7. Risks & Mitigations**

### **7.1 Technical Risks**

* **Math Co-Processor (CORDIC+LUT) timing closure**

  * *Risk:* Fails STA at 80 MHz due to long combinational shift-add paths.
  * *Mitigation:* Add pipeline stages (CORDIC is pipeline-friendly), relax clock to 50 MHz, use “useful skew” in CTS if needed.

* **ECC SRAM overhead**

  * *Risk:* ECC wrapper and scrubber logic consume more area/power than budgeted.
  * *Mitigation:* Trim to 16 KB SRAM (instead of 32 KB), use shared ECC decoder per bank, reduce scrub frequency.

* **Crypto block area/power**

  * *Risk:* ECDSA verify engine in 28 nm exceeds our ≤ 0.6 mm² budget, raising area and transient power.
  * *Mitigation:* Implement *verify-only* datapath with shared multipliers; use microcoded scalar mult.; allow SW fallback for non-critical paths.

* **Secure Boot Latency**

  * *Risk:* ECDSA + SHA verification slows boot significantly.
  * *Mitigation:* Parallelize SHA hashing with ECDSA setup; precompute hashes where possible; keep boot image size minimal.

* **JTAG as attack surface**

  * *Risk:* Debug TAP allows unauthorized access.
  * *Mitigation:* Lifecycle controller locks debug in production; only boundary scan allowed.

---

### **7.2 Verification Risks**

* **Coverage gaps**

  * *Risk:* Limited time may leave corner cases untested.
  * *Mitigation:* Use Python golden models for exhaustive sweeps of CORDIC angles; nightly regressions with constrained random seeds.

* **Fault injection realism**

  * *Risk:* ECC/TMR validation may not reflect real SEUs.
  * *Mitigation:* Use automated fault injection in RTL sims + GLS to mimic bit flips; collect error correction stats.

* **Formal/Assertion debt**

  * *Risk:* Formal proofs on bus handshakes skipped due to time.
  * *Mitigation:* Prioritize critical blocks (APB/AXI-lite, ECC, Boot FSM); de-scope less risky ones if schedule tightens.

---

### **7.3 Physical Design Risks**

* **Routing congestion near SRAM + co-processor**

  * *Risk:* Dense placement causes DRC violations.
  * *Mitigation:* Early floorplan trial; allocate routing channels; spread SRAM macros.

* **IR drop & EM**

  * *Risk:* High toggle in math co-processor causes droop.
  * *Mitigation:* Insert decap cells; widen power straps; run IR/EM checks after CTS.

* **Antenna violations (28 nm)**

  * *Risk:* Long nets in co-processor → antenna DRC failures.
  * *Mitigation:* Early diode insertion; break nets with buffers.

---

### **7.4 Schedule Risks (EE599 alignment)**

* **RTL freeze slips past Proposal (Sept 26)**

  * *Risk:* Too much time spent refining architecture.
  * *Mitigation:* Freeze spec by proposal due date; forbid new features post-Oct 1.

* **DFT insertion too late (post Week 10)**

  * *Risk:* Scan/MBIST retrofit delays signoff.
  * *Mitigation:* Reserve scan ports in RTL from Week 1; run trial DFT by Week 7.

* **Layout convergence**

  * *Risk:* Innovus P\&R runs extend past Week 13 deadline (Nov 21 Layout Due).
  * *Mitigation:* Start floorplanning in Week 8; run block-level STA in parallel; assign weekly PD checkpoints.

* **Demo readiness**

  * *Risk:* Hardware demo scripts not prepared until final week.
  * *Mitigation:* Develop Python host tools + C firmware tests in Week 9; demo flows rehearsed by Week 13.

---

### **7.5 Overall Mitigation Philosophy**

* **Pipeline early, simplify later**: Favor functional correctness and timing closure even if latency increases slightly.
* **Scope discipline**: No new features after Oct 1; only refinements.
* **Parallel tracks**: Verification, DFT, and PD in parallel from mid-semester.
* **Golden reference reliance**: Use Python models as truth source to rapidly validate RTL and post-layout behavior.

---


## **8. Demonstration Plan**

The project will culminate in a **lab demonstration** designed to convincingly validate our chip’s functionality, security, and reliability. The demo must be **repeatable, clear, and easy to measure** within the EE599 timeline, with an optional "lab prototype setup" for visual appeal.

---

### **8.1 Core Demonstration (Simple & Convincing)**

* **Setup:**

  * **Host PC** connected over **SPI/UART** to the SoC (via FPGA prototype or shuttle silicon).
  * Python driver scripts running on host.
  * On-chip RISC-V core executes firmware to control the math co-processor, ECC memory, and security features.

* **Demonstrated Features:**

  1. **Real-Time Phase Computation**

     * Host sends antenna steering angles (θ, φ).
     * On-chip math co-processor (CORDIC+LUT) computes phase values.
     * Results streamed back over UART.
     * Host compares results to Python golden model, displaying error histogram (ULP, RMS error).

  2. **Secure Boot Validation**

     * Boot with a valid signed firmware → system starts normally.
     * Attempt boot with a tampered/unsigned image → secure boot rejects, status flag logged.

  3. **ECC-Protected Memory**

     * Inject a bit flip into SRAM via test CSR.
     * ECC corrects single-bit error (event logged).
     * Double-bit injection → ECC detects error, raises interrupt flag.

  4. **Watchdog Recovery**

     * Host forces CPU into hang (CSR trigger).
     * Watchdog timer resets system cleanly, logged via UART.

* **Deliverables to Professors/Engineers:**

  * Logs from host-PC showing:

    * Phase computation accuracy.
    * Secure boot pass/fail cases.
    * ECC corrections.
    * Watchdog reset.

---

### **8.2 Optional Showcase Demonstration (If Time Permits)**

* **Audio-Band Beamforming Demo:**

  * Use a **4–8 MEMS microphone array** connected to a speaker source.
  * Host sends beam angles to SoC → SoC computes phase coefficients → coefficients fed into FPGA/software beamformer → live beam steering visible in GUI.
  * GUI visualizes microphone array response pattern, showing how phase computations enable beam direction control.

* **GPIO Visualization:**

  * Map computed phase values to GPIOs driving an **LED array**.
  * Phase changes produce visible LED pattern shifts (simple but audience-friendly).

---

### **8.3 Demonstration Criteria**

* **Correctness:** Chip’s output matches golden model within error tolerance (≤0.5° RMS error for phases).
* **Security:** Tampered firmware rejected; only signed code accepted.
* **Reliability:** ECC corrects single-bit error, flags double-bit error.
* **Determinism:** Phase updates complete within ≤200 µs for 32 TRM equivalents.
* **Clarity:** Host-PC logs + plots provide immediate evidence of chip’s correctness and robustness.

---

### **8.4 Why This Demo Works**

* **Simple but Complete:** Even without a full antenna array, logs and plots prove the math accuracy, security enforcement, and ECC resilience.
* **Optional Showy Mode:** Audio-band phased array or LED demo makes it tangible for a broader audience.
* **Aligned with EE599 Schedule:** FPGA prototype enables earlier testing; shuttle silicon demo reuses the same test harness.

### **A.3 Notes**

* **CPU area is well-benchmarked** by the SiFive E31 core in 28 nm HPC.
* **CORDIC area** is backed by a published 28 nm ASIC design (0.09 mm² core); we conservatively upsize to 0.8 mm² including LUT + control.
* **Crypto estimates** are grounded: SHA-256 directly reported at 28 nm; ECDSA verified at 45 nm, scaled conservatively.
* **SRAM** budget relies on published density of \~1.80 Mb/mm² for 28 nm 6T-SRAM, plus large margins for ECC and peripheral overhead.

This appendix visually ties the **literature-backed area estimates** to our **≤ 3.5 mm² SoC target**, making the EEA goals concrete and defensible.

## **Appendix B – Energy Budget (TSMC 28 nm)**

### **B.1 Assumptions & Node Facts**

* **Node & libs:** TSMC **28HPC/HPC+** with nominal **\~0.9–1.2 V core** and **1.8 V I/O**, per foundry-facing docs (Europractice micro-block; TSMC overview). ([Europraactice IC][1])
* **CPU efficiency baseline (for scaling):** SiFive **E31** on **28 nm HPC** achieves **59.4 DMIPS/mW @ 1.4 GHz**; core-only area **0.0286 mm²**; E31 complex **0.187 mm²** (with 16 KB I\$ + 16 KB DTIM). This shows large perf-per-mW headroom at 28 nm relative to our much lower clock (50–80 MHz). ([HubSpot][2])
* **Crypto block scale at 28 nm:** SHA-256 ASICs report **\~0.210 mm²** with **hundreds of MHz** capability, implying small dynamic power when briefly active at modest clocks; ECDSA-P256 verify engines in adjacent literature typically **sub-mm²** (verify-only). ([MDPI][3])

> We budget energy at **50 MHz** system clock (Section 6), use **aggressive clock-gating**, and treat **ECDSA/SHA** as **burst-only** during boot/auth (amortized runtime cost ≪ steady-state).

### **B.2 Module-Level Power Allocation (steady-state @ 50 MHz)**

| Module                             |                         Power Budget | Rationale / Basis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | -----------------------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RISC-V core (RV32IMC-class)**    |                          **≤ 10 mW** | At 28 nm, embedded RISC-V shows very high perf-per-mW (E31: **59.4 DMIPS/mW @ 1.4 GHz**). At **50 MHz** with light duty and clock-gating of unused units, a **single-digit mW** budget is realistic; we set **≤ 10 mW** with margin. ([HubSpot][2])                                                |
| **Math co-processor (CORDIC+LUT)** |                          **≤ 30 mW** | Pipelined CORDICs in **28 nm** are compact and efficient; our throughput target (1 result/1–2 cycles) at **50–80 MHz** implies modest switching. Allocate the **largest runtime share** here to be safe. (CORDIC @ 28 nm reported compact area, enabling deep pipelining at low V/f). ([arXiv][4]) |
| **SRAM + ECC (16–32 KB)**          |                          **≤ 15 mW** | Small on-chip SRAM at **28 nm** is dense (**\~1.80 Mb/mm²** indicative); dynamic depends on access rate. With clock-gated ECC wrapper and scrubber running infrequently, **≤ 15 mW** is conservative. ([arXiv][5])                                                                                 |
| **Crypto (SHA-256 + ECDSA-P256)**  | **≤ 20 mW** (active), **\~0 mW avg** | **Active only during boot/auth.** SHA-256 in **28 nm** runs at **hundreds of MHz** in **\~0.21 mm²**, so short bursts at **50 MHz** will be low energy; ECDSA verify is also bursty (verify-only). We cap **active power ≤ 20 mW**; **amortized runtime \~0**. ([MDPI][3])                         |
| **I/O (SPI/UART/GPIO/JTAG)**       |                           **≤ 5 mW** | Low-speed serial plus GPIO toggles at modest drive; 1.8 V I/Os supported in 28HPC/HPC+. ([Europraactice IC][1])                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Clocks, misc. glue**             |                           **≤ 5 mW** | CTS tree + interconnect at 50 MHz with gating. (28 nm flow norms). ([Europraactice IC][1])                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

**Steady-state total (ex-boot):** **≤ 65 mW**
**Headroom to Section 6 target (≤ 80 mW):** **≥ 15 mW** (for activity spikes / worst-case vectors).

### **B.3 Boot / Authentication Energy**

* **Secure boot (hash + signature verify)** is a **burst** event. Given **SHA-256 @ 28 nm** runs at **\~446 MHz** in \~**0.210 mm²** ASICs, the energy to hash firmware at **50 MHz** is small; **ECDSA-P256 verify** (verify-only) runs once per boot or update. We cap **transient crypto power ≤ 20 mW**, with **≤ 10%** boot-time overhead target (Section 6). ([MDPI][3])

---

### **B.4 Gating & Idle Policy**

* **Clock-gate**: math co-processor, ECC scrubber, crypto cores outside active windows.
* **Voltage domains**: keep single core domain for schedule simplicity; optional power-gating island for crypto if sign-off allows.
* **I/O slew & drive**: minimize I/O dynamic by lowest drive consistent with signal integrity on 1.8 V pads (28HPC/HPC+ IO libs). ([Renesas][6])

---

### **B.5 Sanity-Check vs 28 nm Capability**

* Our entire SoC steady-state budget (**≤ 65 mW**) sits far below what a **1.4 GHz** embedded RISC-V cluster would draw at 28 nm; the **E31 perf-per-mW** data demonstrates ample efficiency headroom for our **50–80 MHz** design point. ([HubSpot][2])
